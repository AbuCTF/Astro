PuzzlVision is a smart Sudoku solver that uses image processing and machine learning to detect and solve puzzles in real-time. It was built with TensorFlow models and integrated with a Tkinter GUI.

The project trains on digit recognition data and uses OpenCV to preprocess input Sudoku images for accurate detection.
