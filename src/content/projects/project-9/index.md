NodeCrypt is a secure backend system built for a file-sharing web application. It extends the project 'File System Encryption using AES-256 over HTTPS' by integrating web protocols with robust backend logic.

The system allows users to upload encrypted files over HTTPS, storing them securely in MongoDB. It uses Express.js for server routing, EJS for templating, and PM2 for process management, with support for SFTP-based secure retrieval.
